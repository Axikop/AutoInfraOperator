# ðŸ¤– AutoInfraOp: The AI DevOps Agent

This project is a powerful demonstration of a modern, tool-based AI agent built with CrewAI and LangChain. The agent acts as an autonomous DevOps assistant, capable of analyzing a public GitHub repository's infrastructure configuration, identifying best-practice violations, and automatically creating detailed issues with AI-generated suggestions for fixes.

This project showcases a practical application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve a real-world software engineering problem, bridging the gap between AI and DevOps.

## ðŸ“Š Project in Action

The application features a simple Streamlit UI where a user can input a GitHub repository URL. The agent then begins its analysis, and its final report and actions (the created GitHub issues) can be seen in the target repository.
